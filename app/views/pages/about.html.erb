          For as long as I can remember, I've loved exploring different arts and craft - jewelry making, painting, crochet, scrapbook - you name it, I've probably tried it.
          But like so many creative souls, my enthusiasm for each new medium would burn bright... and then fade just as quickly. What I didn't realize was that my art room was quietly turning into a time capsule of past creative phases, overflowing with supplies I wasn't using but couldn't bear to throw away.

          One day, faced with the daunting task of decluttering, I realized just how much untouched (or barely used) art material I had. And I wasn't alone. After chatting with my mom and a friend, I found out they had their own growing collections of abandoned supplies. It hit me. I needed to figure out a way they could find new life in someone else's hands!

          With that simple idea, I gathered up our supplies, reserved a space at the Oak Park Public Library, and started spreading the word with local businesses and a Facebook event.
          I had no idea what to expect, but on the day of our first Free Art Supplies Exchange, 35 people showed up, each bringing their own supplies to share, each leaving with fresh inspiration.

          What started as a small, one-time event has now grown into a thriving community of over 150 creatives. The Community Exchange isn't just about swapping supplies; it's about fostering creativity, sustainability, and connection.
          What once felt like a personal struggle of too many supplies, too little use, turned into an opportunity to bring people together, reduce waste, and keep the creative spirit alive.

          And it all started with a simple question: <em>What am I going to do with all this stuff?</em>
